      <h2>Why Parking Pal?</h2>
      <p>
        Did you know that drivers spend an average of 17 hours per year searching for parking? On college campuses and office complexes, this number can be even higher during peak hours, leading to frustration, wasted time, and increased emissions from idling cars. Parking Pal aims to eliminate this problem by providing real-time updates on available parking spaces. With our app, you can avoid the hassle of circling lots and instead head straight to an open spot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parking Pal is especially beneficial for large university and office campuses, where parking is often limited and spread across multiple lots. Using cutting-edge technology like RFID sensors and GPS tracking, our app pinpoints open spots so you donâ€™t have to guess. This not only improves convenience but also reduces traffic congestion, helps the environment, and enhances productivity for students and professionals alike. Join the waitlist today and take the first step toward smarter, stress-free parking.
